## Files
The Java Workload Scheduler Web Starter application contains the following:
- **javaCloudantWorkloadSchedulerApp.war**  
  This WAR file is actually the application itself. It is the only file that is be pushed to, and run on, the Bluemix cloud. Every time your application code is updated, you need to regenerate this WAR file and push it to Bluemix again. See the [Build](#build) section for detailed steps.
- **src/main/webapp**  
  This directory contains the client side code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) of your application.
- **src/main/java**  
  This directory contains the server side code (JAVA) of your application.
- **pom.xml**  
  This file allows you to easily build your application using Apache Maven.
- **lib/**  
  This directory contains external libraries that you need to compile the app. 
    
## Build
This section explains how to compile the app and manually generate a deployable artifact. If you just wish to try it using the precompiled war, skip to the [Deploy](#deploy) section.

- Make sure you have an installed and working instance of Apache Maven, using Java 1.7 or above. You also need git.
- Clone this project:  
```
git clone https://github.com/WAdev0/WAProjects.git
```
- Move to the newly created folder:  
```
cd WAProjects/javacloudantworkschedbp/app
```
- Build the app  
```
mvn package
```  
You can find the deployable war _javaCloudantWorkloadSchedulerApp.war_ under the _target_ folder.

## Deploy
This section explains how to run the application on the Bluemix environment.

- Create a new app using the [Java Workload Scheduler Web Starter](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/java-workload-scheduler-web-starter/) boilerplate.
- Download the precompiled [javaCloudantWorkloadSchedulerApp.war](https://github.com/MatteoVettosiHCL/java-cloudant-workload-scheduler-app/raw/master/javaCloudantWorkloadSchedulerApp.war) from this repo or, if you want to build the application manually, follow the [Build](#build) section instructions and go to the _target_ directory  
```
cd target
```
- Follow the instructions in the _Start Coding_ section to install and setup the command line tools for Bluemix.
- Using the ad-hoc commands in the same page, authenticate to the service and push your application to the cloud.
   - Optionally, modify the push command to only upload the war and save bandwidth:  
   ```
   cf push <YourAppName> -p javaCloudantWorkloadSchedulerApp.war
   ```

## Setup
If you wish to receive an email confirmation for every order processed by the app, you need a Unix/Linux machine connected to the internet, with the _mailx_ command installed and configured.  
- under _Services_, click the _Workload Scheduler_ section 
- Click _Downloads_
- Download the agent for your linux architecture on your linux machine
- Unzip the agent:  
```
unzip /tmp/SCWA-SaaS_LINUX_X86_64.zip
```
- Move to the new folder:  
```
cd SCWA-SaaS/
```
- Create a user for the agent:  
```
useradd -m iws
```
- Install the agent using the command:  
```
./installAgent.sh -new -acceptlicense yes -uname iws -displayname hybrid
```
- While waiting for the Application Lab to discover the newly installed agent, set the environment variables for the sender and recipient email:
  - Click the _Runtime_ tab
  - Click the _Environment Variables_ tab
  - Scroll to the _USER-DEFINED_ section
  - Add a _FROM_ and a _TO_ variable containing the sender and recipient email address, respectively.
  - **Note**: for some specific services, like _Gmail_, additional configurations may be needed on the agent machine.

## Usage
Once the deployed app is online, click its link and select some beers, then click the _Checkout_ button. During the waiting time, what happens under the curtains is the following:
- By using the official Cloudant Java Library, the app creates a document with the order information in a database called _orders_.
- With the help of the Java Application Lab library, the app creates (if it does not exist) a _Library_ and a _Process_ inside it
  - If the _FROM_ and _TO_ environment variables are defined, a step using the hybrid agent is created to send a notification with the order information.
- The app runs the _OrderProcess_ process asynchronously:
  1. A Cloudant READ DOCUMENT step is run on the Bluemix order database, to read the ALL_DOCS document and get the doc_id of the first order to be processed.  
  2. A Cloudant READ DOCUMENT step is run, to read the first order to be processed. 
  3. If enabled, an executable step is run on the retail premises warehouse, to start the delivery of the goods and the payment process, and to finally send a confirmation email to customers. 
  4. A Cloudant DELETE DOCUMENT step is run on the Bluemix order database, to delete the order just processed.
